# NOTE TAKER

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-purple)<br />

## Description
This application is an express.js Note Taker.  It makes it easy to create, save and delete notes on a fully functioning website.  The development of this app uses express.js on the back end.  It is connected to the front end JS and HTML files using middleware.  The db.jason file holds the data of the notes, and each note is given an id which can be accessed and deleted when the "trash can" icon is clicked. 

## FYI
This ReadMe.md was created using the README GENERATOR that I created in a previous challenge for Vanderbilt Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp!
